If you want to Run JavaScript code, you will need to a few things:

# 1) Download NodeJS. NodeJS is a "JavaScript Runtime Environement". In other words, NodeJS will allow for you to run JavaScript programs.
    -- https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    -- Node 18.12.1
    -- macOS Installer

# 2) Open a new Terminal in VSCode
    -- Terminal > New Terminal
    -- The terms 'Terminal' and 'Command Line' are interchangeable.

# 3) Make sure you are in the correct folder within Terminal / Command Line
    -- Will need to use Linux Commands
    -- https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/linux-commands
    -- 'pwd' will check to see the correct folder you are in within the Terminal
    -- 'ls' will check all the items in the folder
    -- 'cd' will change directories in the Command line

# 4) Run the command 'node -v' to checks the version of Node on your machine.
    
# 5) Run the command 'node javascript_fundamentals.js'
    -- The command 'node' is only availble because we downloaded Node in Step 1.
    -- 'node [name of javascript file]' will execute the javascript file in the Command Line.
